gvbFormPos Control - Version 01.00.00
-------------------------------------

Welcome to the initial release of the gvbFormPos Control - Version 
01.00.00 designed to handle the positioning of any SDI or MDI forms with
one line of code.

Just a quick note to get you started:-

 Before loading any of the projects into the IDE, the OCX must be 
 extracted and registered. There is a zip file in the 
 '.\gvbFormPos\Runtime' directory. Unzip the files into the directory and
 register the gvbFormPos.Ocx file ("$System$\regsvr32 
 $Install_Dir$\gvbFormPos\Runtime\gvbFormPos.Ocx" - Directory must be 8.3
 format [Where $System$ = Windows System Directory & $Install_Dir$ is the
 host drive and directory for the cTreeview directory (e.g. 
 c:\Windows\System\regsvr32 c:\MyProj~1\gvbFormPos\Runtime\gvbFormPos.Ocx)].

Enjoy!
